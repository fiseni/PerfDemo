I also rewrote the implementations in C out of curiosity. The C version of `Processor5` completed the execution in just 0.21 seconds, more than 10,000 faster than the original code. The C implementation can be found in the following [repository](https://github.com/fiseni/PerfDemoC). If you'd like to contribute and participate in the challenge, you can find all the necessary details in the repo.
