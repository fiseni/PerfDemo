<strong>UPDATE:</strong> I gave this challenge another shot. I rewrote the implementations in C and made some further optimizations. It completed the execution in just 0.21 seconds, more than 10,000 faster than the original code. The C implementation can be found in the following [repository](https://github.com/fiseni/PerfDemoC). If you want to contribute and participate in the challenge, you can find all the necessary details in the repo.
